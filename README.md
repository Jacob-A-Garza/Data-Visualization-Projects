# Retail Sales Performance Dashboard

## A Power BI analysis of multi-store retail performance

## üìå Problem Statement

This project analyzes anonymized retail sales data to:
- Compare Year To Date sales vs. goals across stores and locations
- Identify trends in new vs. established store performance
- Evaluate category-level sales variances (e.g., Womens vs. Juniors)

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

Data Exploration:
- Cleaned and validated data integrity by resolving naming conflicts, removing null entries, and fixing inconsistencies.
- Built relationships between stores, districts, and sales metrics to enable cross-filtering in dashboards.
- Modeled KPIs including fiscal period comparisons, sales density ($/sq ft), and goal variance tracking.

Key Visualizations:
- Sales Attainment Gauges - Track progress toward annual goals.
- Geospatial Maps - Compare regional performance.
- Variance Analysis - Identify under-performing and over-performing categories.

## üìä Results

Top Findings:
- Fashions Direct‚Äôs total sales ($16M) were 167% higher than Lindseys' ($6M)
